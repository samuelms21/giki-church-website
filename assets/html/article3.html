      <p>
        At some point, many Christians experience unsettling doubts regarding
        their professed beliefs. Some Christians experience this more than
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The areas of our individual doubt struggles are as diverse and complex
        as our Christian faith claims. Some battle doubts about the genuineness
        of their conversion (“Have I truly been born again?”). Some battle
        doubts about the character of God (“Is God truly good?”). Some battle
        doubts about the validity of their theological framework (“Does
        Calvinism truly represent the biblical revelation of God’s nature,
        purposes, and actions?”). Some battle doubts about the authenticity of
        their spiritual experiences (“Was my remarkably fast health recovery
        after receiving prayer truly a divine healing?”). Some battle doubts
        about the veracity of the Christian faith itself (“Does God truly
        exist?” or “Does another religion or belief system more truly reveal the
        nature of ultimate reality?”). Some battle a hodgepodge of these and
        still other kinds of doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most Christians, the intensity of their doubts falls into the mildly
        to moderately troubling range. In relation to faith-health, these
        battles with doubt are like battling a bad cold or flu — they require
        care, but they are not faith-threatening. However, a minority of
        Christians (though I’d say a substantial minority) endure one or more
        seasons of doubt so intense we’ve given them a special term: faith
        crises.
      </p>
      <h4>When Doubts Become Crises</h4>
      <p>
        To call these experiences crises is not hyperbole. When a confluence of
        factors moves us to question whether our fundamental understanding of
        reality is indeed true, it can feel like our world is on the verge of
        collapse. In relation to faith-health, this kind of doubt is more like a
        heart attack or stroke.
      </p>
      <p>
        I say this from experience. Like everyone, I occasionally battle some
        doubts that are like a cold or the flu. But more than once in my
        forty-year sojourn as a Christian, I’ve also endured doubts more like a
        heart attack. I know the oppressive spiritual darkness, the agonizing
        fear, the disorienting confusion, the sense of isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I am part of the substantial minority of Christians who have (or
        will) experience this, I thought it might be helpful if I briefly
        describe the emotional and psychological state a person often is in when
        such a crisis hits. My goal is to increase awareness in Christians —
        especially those who have not experienced a faith crisis themselves — of
        the destabilized state someone enduring a faith crisis can be in. Such
        awareness can help us extend the most needed kinds of initial “crisis
        care” when ministering grace to beloved brothers and sisters who are
        reeling.
      </p>
      <h4>Stage 1: The Build-Up</h4>
      <p>
        A person’s faith crisis often appears to happen suddenly. Someone you
        know (perhaps you) seems to have a strong, sturdy faith. Then, all of
        sudden, it looks like their faith is falling apart. And you wonder,
        “What happened?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although that’s the way it often appears, rarely do such crises come out
        of nowhere. Almost always, destabilizing elements have been building up
        under the surface, even if the person wasn’t fully aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of us experience and observe realities that don’t seem to make sense
        within our Christian worldview or our theological framework. Often,
        we’re able to mentally file these under Scriptural categories such as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Proverbs 3:5: Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on
        your own understanding.
        <br />
        Or Isaiah 55:8–9: My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
        ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the
        earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your
        thoughts.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But some people, over time, gradually accumulate sufficient, seemingly
        incoherent experiences and observations that their faith becomes
        destabilized, often more than they realize. Each experience or
        observation on its own likely causes them only mild to moderate
        confusion or unsettledness — it looks and feels much like the doubt
        common to all believers, which may be why they don’t more urgently
        address them prior to the crisis moment. But if enough
        faith-destabilizing elements build up, such people, even if they don’t
        consciously realize it, become vulnerable to a faith crisis, only
        needing the right (or wrong) catalyst to set it off.
      </p>
      <h4>Stage 2: The Catalyst</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes a catalyst moment is a significant life event, like a betrayal
        or a tragedy. But often, it is an apparently and surprisingly
        insignificant event, like an offhanded comment someone makes in an
        ordinary conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the catalyst event, when it occurs it ignites a kind of chain
        reaction. It’s as if the various destabilizing elements that have built
        up now psychologically fuse together into a sudden awareness that the
        person’s belief system — Christianity as ultimate reality — might not be
        true, but might instead be, like other belief systems, a human
        construct. This awareness produces a kind of internal explosion: a faith
        crisis (which nowadays some might refer to as a deconstruction).
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s important to keep in mind when ministering to someone
        experiencing this, especially in the early stages of the crisis, is that
        the catalyst event, whether extraordinary or mundane, is frequently not
        what’s only, or even mainly, fueling the person’s crisis. Often,
        well-meaning friends coming alongside a person in faith crisis can focus
        too much on the catalyst and give too little attention to the doubts and
        experiences that built up over months or years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The catalyst is more like a lit match dropped on an accumulated pile of
        tinder, or like the last Jenga block pulled that suddenly brings the
        weakened structure down. And when it happens, the person usually finds
        himself suddenly caught in a raging spiritual tempest.
      </p>
      <h4>Stage 3: The Storm</h4>
      <p>
        For those who haven’t experienced a faith crisis, it’s hard to capture
        in words what it feels like. As I have tried, I have found a storm to be
        a helpful metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human brain is a remarkably, even incomprehensibly, powerful and
        complex creation. The speed at which it can process, especially in a
        state of alarm, is incredible. And people in the initial stages of a
        faith crisis are typically in a state of alarm. The brain is processing
        in overdrive — and not only processing the Christian claims in question,
        but the possible implications of those bedrock claims proving untrue.
        And they’re trying to resolve those overwhelming questions in a storm of
        anguishing emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If those who have taken their faith seriously suddenly and unexpectedly
        experience the kind of internal faith explosion I described above,
        resulting in intense doubts regarding their fundamental beliefs, these
        are the sorts of implications crashing in on them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That God — the Person they have most profoundly trusted, most deeply
          loved, most passionately worshiped, the one they believed they have
          experienced and been led by, the one they’ve oriented their whole life
          around and taught others about — might not be real.
        </li>
        <li>
          And if God’s not real, much of what they’ve found meaningful in life
          would either be a delusion or built on a delusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          And if they’ve been deluded, what is real? What does everything mean?
          They wonder, “Who am I?”
        </li>
        <li>
          And if they were to lose their faith, they’d grieve and confuse
          believing family members and friends they love deeply, and lose a
          priceless dimension of relational connection they have shared with
          those loved ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          And they would lose the church community that has been integral to
          their lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          And if they’re in vocational ministry — because pastors, missionaries,
          and vocational Christian workers of all kinds are not immune from
          faith crises — then they’d lose both the missional purpose that
          oriented their lives as well as gainful employment. And what would
          they do, or even want to do, next?
        </li>
        <li>
          And most frightening of all, if they were to lose their faith only to
          discover too late that their doubts had deceived them, they would be
          condemned to hell, and may cause others to stumble and end up there
          too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hopefully you can see why this experience is so often psychologically
        disorienting and emotionally distressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I want to stress here is that when we are ministering to those who
        have recently entered a faith crisis, it’s important to get as clear a
        sense as possible of their state of mind before attempting to seriously
        engage the faith questions they’re wrestling with. Because for some,
        their inner turmoil, their internal storm, is overwhelming. I like to
        say that when a faith crisis hits, it’s like trying to think and discern
        clearly in a hurricane. It’s wise to assume strugglers’ anxiety and fear
        levels are running high, that they’re depressed, and they’re in need of
        rest, since this experience often robs them of sleep at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, what a person in faith crisis often needs most is not
        immediate answers, but shelter.
      </p>
      <h4>Providing Shelter in the Storm</h4>
      <p>
        Shelter is what anyone caught in raging storm seeks. A shelter doesn’t
        end a storm, but it does provide a storm-tossed struggler a measure of
        needed respite, safety, and peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jude instructs us to “have mercy on those who doubt” (Jude 22).
        Providing merciful shelter for a Christian in the tumultuous throes of a
        faith crisis is one way to show mercy, and one of the most important
        initial ways we can extend “crisis care” to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what does it mean to provide spiritual shelter for someone in this
        kind of spiritual storm? Like most parts in the Christian life, there’s
        no simple formula. People’s faith-crisis experiences are unique. Their
        doubts are unique, their contexts are unique, their histories are
        unique, their temperaments are unique, their spiritual-maturity levels
        are unique, and so on. Therefore, the kind of merciful shelter each
        person needs will be unique. Faith crises are complex, and God’s mercy
        is many-faceted.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we know what people experience when they find a storm shelter: their
        fear reduces, they breathe easier, and they’re able to rest. In a
        spiritual shelter, a person can be open and honest about their doubts
        and fears, release pent-up emotions, and God willing, gain some
        much-needed, Spirit-granted perspective and guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing this kind of merciful shelter for someone requires
        discernment. And discernment requires a listening ear. Which means,
        while God hasn’t given us a one-size-fits-all formula for how to do
        this, he has given us a governing principle we can apply: “Let every
        person [who wishes to have mercy on those who doubt] be quick to hear
        [and] slow to speak” (James 1:19). This is crucial because we won’t know
        what (or if) to speak unless we have first carefully and prayerfully
        heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as we seek to care for those in a faith crisis, we’re wise to
        remember that (1) the crisis is often the sudden explosion of doubts
        that have accumulated over time, (2) the crisis is often ignited by a
        catalyst event that may itself not be fueling their doubts, and (3)
        their most pressing initial need may not be our immediately addressing
        their doubts, but experiencing through us the sheltering mercy of Jesus,
        who extends this invitation to all strugglers: “Come to me, all who
        labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).
