      <p>
        It is one of the most audacious, and awe-inspiring, moments in all of
        Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the wake of Israel’s shocking rebellion against God — blatantly
        violating the covenant God just made with them — Moses humbly dares to
        mediate between God and his people. At the climax of his intercession,
        and his careful yet determined dialogue with the living God, Moses makes
        what is perhaps the greatest, and most perceptive, petition a creature
        can of his Creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it is, after all, a prayer — a modest yet bold request, made by man,
        to God Almighty: “Please show me your glory.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That this is, in some sense, a special moment is plain. We do not stand
        in Moses’s sandals. We are not prophets called to mediate a covenant,
        nor do we live under that Sinai pact. Yet Moses’s prayer still functions
        as a model for the godly after him. It will not be the last prayer in
        Scripture for a sight of God’s glory, and rightly do the faithful echo
        it today. What might we who are in Christ learn about our own prayers
        from the amazing sequence of Moses’s pressing into God in Exodus 32–33?
      </p>
      <h4>Can and Will God Forgive?</h4>
      <p>
        Before wrestling with the prayer itself, we need to first acknowledge
        Moses’s haunting question: Could and would God forgive the people such a
        horrific breach of the covenant? Moses was not yet sure. He heard
        stories of his forefathers, encountered God at the bush, and witnessed
        the plagues in Egypt and the rescue in the Red Sea. Moses knew a
        powerful God who had delivered his people, but would he also forgive
        them?
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, it looked like he wouldn’t. When God first informed Moses, on
        the mountain, that the people had “corrupted themselves,” by making and
        worshiping a golden calf (32:7–8), God had said, “Let me alone, that my
        wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them. . .” (32:10). As
        Moses began to plead that God withhold destruction, it was far from
        clear that any relationship of peace could be fully restored.
      </p>
      <p>
        God did relent of immediately consuming the people (32:14), yet the
        covenant remained broken. Although Moses went down the mountain,
        confronted the people in their rebellion, burnt the calf, disciplined
        the people (32:15–20), and oversaw the purging of the three thousand who
        led in the rebellion (32:21–29), Moses knew this did not restore what
        lay shattered. The next day, he returned to meet God on the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives Moses’s sequence of prayer in Exodus 33 is the question he
        begins to ask in 32:32: Can and will Yahweh forgive? Will God restore
        the relationship, and dwell among them, after they had worshiped the
        golden calf? And as we will see, God draws prayer out of Moses, and then
        moves to answer Moses’s question, in a way far more powerful, and
        memorable, than if there had not been an unfolding, developing,
        deepening relationship with God.
      </p>
      <h4>Moses, Teach Us to Pray</h4>
      <p>
        Exodus 33 begins with God declaring to the people that even though he
        will give them the land promised to their forefathers, God himself will
        not go up among them (33:3). They mourn this “disastrous word.” They
        want him, not just the promised land. They humble themselves before God,
        taking off their ornaments “from Mount Horeb onward” (33:6).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the people heard this disastrous word, however, Moses
        continues to enjoy remarkable favor with God. In a tent pitched far off
        from the camp, God speaks with Moses (33:9), and verse 11 comments:
        “Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to
        his friend.” This sets the scene for Moses’s remarkable intercessory
        prayer in 33:12–18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe, then, at least three lessons Christians today might take from
        Moses’s otherwise inimitable prayer.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Prayer responds to God.</h4>
      <p>
        The living God takes the initiative. He first announced to Moses the
        people’s breach of the covenant (32:7–10). And he revealed his enduring
        favor on Moses, prompting the prophet to reply. So too for us. We don’t
        just “dial up” God in prayer when we so wish. First, he speaks, as he
        has revealed himself in his world, and in his word, and in his Son, the
        Word. In prayer, we respond to him in light of his revelation to us.
        First, we hear his voice in Scripture; then we access his ear in prayer.
        We pray in light of what he has promised.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Prayer pleads God’s reputation and glory.</h4>
      <p>
        When God announces to Moses the peoples’ sin, and the intention to
        destroy them and start over with him, Moses’s reflex is to lean into
        God’s own reputation. This is a good reflex. “Why should the Egyptians
        say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the
        mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’?” (Exodus
        21:12).
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses prays for God to turn from righteous anger and relent “from this
        disaster against your people,” for God’s own name’s sake. Moses does not
        plea the people’s worth — or their humanity, made in God’s image — but
        God’s choice and word. He chose them as his people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we are in good company to pray for God’s own reputation in the
        world, and to take notice of, and pray, God’s own promises back to him.
        God loves for his people to pray in light of what he’s said to us, to
        make our pleas in response to his promises. And praying for his glory
        not only concerns God’s reputation in the world, but also, and most
        significantly, our own knowing and enjoying him. At the bottom of prayer
        to such a God is our longing for his face, not merely the provisions of
        his hand.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Prayer can be incremental and sequential.</h4>
      <p>
        We might even call Moses’s prayer “dialogical.” It is striking how
        relational his process and sequence of prayer is in these chapters.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of the “dialogue,” reverent as it is, is whose people the
        Israelites are, a topic God introduces and draws Moses into. First, to
        Moses, God calls them, after their sin, “your people, whom you brought
        up out of the land of Egypt” (32:7). Then God introduces the surprising
        tension of his ongoing favor on Moses. God will consume the people and
        “make a great nation” of Moses (32:9–10). This favor, combined with
        calling the nation “your people,” presents Moses an invitation to reply
        in prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses asks to know more about this God — “please show me now your ways”
        (33:13) — to discern whether God will forgive his stiff-necked nation.
        And Moses meekly, but importantly, appends this to this first plea:
        “Consider too that this nation is your people.” God answers positively,
        though briefly: “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest”
        (33:14). The short reply invites Moses to press in further, for the sake
        of the people. His “me” moves to “us.” He pleads for “I and your
        people”; then again “we . . . I and your people.” Moses identifies
        himself with the people, asking that God’s favor on him extend to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prayer, by human persons to the living and personal God, is far more
        than transactional. It is relational, and often incremental, with
        measured, humble boldness. God leads us, like Moses, into prayer. We
        make our requests. He answers in time. We learn more of him, which leads
        us to ask to see more of him.
      </p>
      <h4>‘Show Me Your Glory’</h4>
      <p>
        Moses’s prayerful dialogue with God has become more and more daring —
        slowly, one incremental plea at a time: Don’t consume your people
        (32:11–13). Please forgive your people (32:31–32). Show me your ways
        (33:13). Count the people with me in my favor with you (33:15–16). And
        now, most boldly, “Please show me your glory” (33:18).
      </p>
      <p>
        This short but daring plea will be Moses’s last. He will not speak again
        until 34:9, when he finally completes the plea for forgiveness he left
        unfinished in 32:32.
      </p>
      <p>In Exodus 33:19, God begins to respond:</p>
      <blockquote>
        I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you
        my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
        and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. (Exodus 33:19)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Moses receives his full answer, however, a chapter later in Exodus 34:7
        with another revelation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God
        merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love
        and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving
        iniquity and transgression and sin. (Exodus 34:6–7). The driving
        question has been answered, and so Moses bows in worship and prays with
        confidence, “O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us . . . and
        pardon our iniquity and our sin . . .” (34:9). Having prayed, and seen
        the glory in God’s declarations about his character, his goodness, his
        mercy, his grace, Moses is confident that God will grant forgiveness and
        renew the covenant.
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Christ, Our Moses</h4>
      <p>
        For Christians today, any Moses-like leveraging of God’s favor we know
        to be firmly grounded in his favor on Christ. More significant than our
        echoes and imitations of Moses is the fulfillment of his intercession,
        and final mediation for God’s people, in Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may indeed glean some categories and concepts from Moses’s prayers.
        Yet, as we come in Christ to Exodus 32–33, we identify not only with the
        prophet, but with the people. They are “stiff-necked.” Rebellious.
        Deserving of divine justice. Desperate for mercy and grace. But in
        Christ, we have one far greater than Moses who intercedes for us,
        leveraging his own perfect favor with God on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus, our great high priest, “has passed through the heavens,” and
        calls us to “draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, [to]
        receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:14,
        16). And he does so not only as new-covenant mediator and intercessor,
        but also as the very one in whose face we see the glory of God. What was
        unique in ancient Israel — speaking to God “as a man speaks to his
        friend” — is offered to all who are in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        God now invites us to come to him as Father, and to come to Christ as
        husband — the deepest and nearest of human relationships — not to make
        requests, get what we want, pivot, and go back to life apart from him,
        but to come closer, and nearer, through prayer, and discover again and
        again that he himself, in Christ, is the great reward.
